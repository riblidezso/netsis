# Course project: Study epidemics numerically in the SIS model on computer generated directed networks.



> Study epidemics numerically in the SIS model on computer generated directed networks. What is the difference between spreading on Erdos- Renyi, and on scale-free networks? In case of scale-free networks, examine whether it makes a difference if only the in- (or out-) degree distribution is scale-free?

> Reproduce the main figures from the following paper: Romualdo Pastor- Satorras, Alessandro Vespignani, “Epidemic dynamics and endemic states in complex networks”, Phys. Rev. E 63, 066117 (2001).
