# Course project: Study epidemics numerically in the SIS model on computer generated directed networks.



Study epidemics numerically in the SIS model on computer generated directed networks. What is the difference between spreading on Erdos- Renyi, and on scale-free networks? In case of scale-free networks, examine whether it makes a difference if only the in- (or out-) degree distribution is scale-free?
